As the clock ticks down to Christmas Eve, Santa is preparing to eat all the cookies left by children all over the world. But amidst the holiday cheer, a small problem has arisen – how can we keep track of how many cookies Santa has munched!

You’ve been tasked with creating a Cookie Counter which can show the tally of cookies munched. We should also be able to add, remove, and reset the count.

If you’re up for it, you could consider adding a feature that shows Santa’s mood based on the number of cookies eaten – maybe he gets a little merrier with each cookie!
